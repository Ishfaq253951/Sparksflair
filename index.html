      Fear arose as I walked passed the house. Just glancing at the door gave me goosebumbs.The street was ghost-quiet; not a single mosquito buzzingin the night. The moon itself had disappeared. But suddenly a commotion was heard in the house. I fidgetted around to make out the figure of a women in front of me. Before I could see her face, she clutched my body and dragged me into the spooky domicile.<br><br>
      
      At that particular instant, I wondered what she would do to me. The next thing I remember is that I found myself, tightly tied to a chair, in a cell dimly lit. The windows to my left were shut and tinted. I could not see outside. To my right beared a wooden door, securely enclosed by locks. My hands were attached to the back of the chair and my legs were binded to the foot of the furniture. The room gave a pungent smell. The air was stiff. I could not see anything else in the cell. Then, out of a sudden, it became all foggy. In mere seconds my vision was blurred. Eventhough I could not espy anything, I could sense danger coming my way. And just like that a couple of minutes passed before I passed out.
